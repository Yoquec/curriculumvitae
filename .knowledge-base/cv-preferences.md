# CV Writing Preferences & Guidelines

## Writing Style Preferences

### What to AVOID

- Marketing buzzwords and corporate speak:
  - "industry-standard", "cutting-edge", "global scale"
  - "rapid deployment", "scalable infrastructure"
  - "extensive", "enhanced skills", "leveraging"
  - "spearheaded", "engineered", "utilizing"
- Vague statements without concrete backing
- Learning/skill development statements (focus on achievements, not what was learned)
- Underselling work or using tentative language
- Time estimates or scheduling language in plans

### What to EMPHASIZE

- Specific, concrete metrics (99.9%, 80%, 100+)
- Geographic scale with specific regions
- Technical achievements and capabilities
- Leadership in technical architecture
- Cross-organizational coordination
- Real impact and outcomes

### Language Rules

- Past tense for all completed work
- Active voice, strong action verbs
- Specific over generic
- Honest about scope (initiated vs completed)
- "Deployed is deployed" - don't mention beta/pilot status

## Formatting Conventions

### Technology Names

- Use italics for technologies: `\textit{Golang}`, `\textit{React}`
- Correct capitalizations:
  - GitHub (not Github)
  - PyTorch (not Pytorch)
  - GraphQL
  - TypeScript

### Bold Text Usage

- **Metrics and scale:** 100+, 99.9%, 80%, globally
- **Key achievements:** Architected, Led, Built
- **Important technical components:** CI/CD pipelines, communication protocol, serverless Web API
- **Geographic scope:** North America, South America, Europe, Asia
- **Academic honors and GPA scores**
- **Key skills in introduction:** AI/ML, Rust, Nix

### Organization

- Group technologies by category (languages → frameworks → infrastructure)
- Order by: backend languages, frontend languages/frameworks, tools, cloud services
- Keep consistency across all job entries

## Content Strategy

### What Makes Strong Bullet Points

1. **Action verb** + **specific technical work** + **concrete outcome/metric**
2. Lead with what you built/designed/architected
3. Include scale when available (facilities, users, regions)
4. Show technical depth without revealing IP
5. Connect to business impact when possible

### When to Combine Information

- Don't mention the same concept twice in one entry
- Combine related achievements into single bullet if appropriate
- Reduce repetition across entries (e.g., "PLC" vs "operational device data")

### Technology Lists

- Must be complete - include all technologies mentioned in bullets
- Order by category for readability
- Keep consistent formatting

## Professional Positioning

### Core Narrative

"Software Engineer bridging artificial intelligence and software architecture across the stack"

### Key Messages

1. Strong AI/ML academic foundation (Data Science degree)
2. Proven ability to build production systems at scale
3. Technical leadership (protocol design, architecture)
4. Full-stack capability (embedded systems to cloud, frontend to backend)
5. Cross-organizational coordination skills
6. Current focus on reliable systems (Rust) and reproducible builds (Nix)

### Target Audience

- Primarily European software engineering roles
- Balance: Technical depth + architectural leadership

## Specific Decisions Made

### Projects Section

- **Removed** in favor of languages section and professional introduction
- Projects remain visible on GitHub

### Introduction Placement

- Appears directly after name/title as italicized quote
- Length: 3 sentences
- Focus: Bridge between AI/ML background and current systems work

### Company Mentions

- Amazon is in job titles (unavoidable)
- Focus on technical work, not company branding
