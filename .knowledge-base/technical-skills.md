## Skill Progression & Identity
- **Core Identity:** Bridges AI/ML background with practical software engineering
- **Strength:** Combines statistical rigor from Data Science degree with programming excellence
- **Current Interests:** Reliable systems programming (Rust), reproducible builds (Nix)
- **Career Arc:** From AI/stats background → backend engineering → systems architecture
- **Not specialized in:** Embedded controllers (works WITH them but not specialized)

## Communication Preferences
- Avoids marketing buzzwords ("industry-standard", "cutting-edge", "global scale", "rapid", "scalable")
- Prefers specific metrics over vague claims
- Values honesty and concrete achievements
- "Deployed is deployed" - doesn't undersell work (beta status is internal detail)
